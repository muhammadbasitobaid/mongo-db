## Scaling:
  - Horizontal: 
    - [-] + [-] + [-] + ... (shards multiple instance of database are created.)
    - NoSQL easily support sharding.

  - Vertical: 
    - [-] (more resources are added to same server like increasing ram and disk space)
       +
      [-]
       +
      [-]
    - SQL databases are generally scaled vertically.
